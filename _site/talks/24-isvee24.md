Introduction: Viral hemorrhagic fevers caused by New World Arenaviruses have a high potential burden in susceptible human populations. The spillover risk from rodent reservoirs to humans is significantly affected by rodent distribution and movement patterns of humans. The aim of this study was to (i) model the climate-change driven risk of zoonotic spillover of New World arenaviruses and (ii) estimate the projected burdens of these outbreaks in the context of various climate scenarios.
Methods: Ensemble Species Distribution Models (SDMs) were trained on current bioclimatic and landscape data of the known rodent reservoirs of New World Arenaviruses. By combining the SDMs with the human population, current and predicted hotspots for the zoonotic outbreak were investigated. Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) namely, SSP 2 and 5 were taken into consideration to make projections for years 2050 and 2070. Using this information combined with comparable outbreaks, a stochastic model was developed for estimating the economic and health burdens. 
Results: SDMs of rodent reservoirs of Junin virus in Argentina and Guanarito virus in Venezuela and Colombia yielded high precision in predicting species habitats (83% to 91%). Projections of SDM in SSP2 showed some persistent hotspots for spillover in both 2050 (see Figure) and 2070. Variability in predicted economic burden depends on the validity of economic inputs.
Discussion: Our study provides valuable insights into potential shifts of risk patterns by leveraging machine learning. Predicting the changes in spillover hotspots, the models help understand expected burden and hence will be helpful to develop policy based on both economic and health burden.
Conclusion: Climate change will facilitate the risk of arenaviral infections to newer regions, changing the economic burden. The framework of the study has potential to serve as a climate-driven, predicted risk tool for rodent-borne zoonotic outbreaks and to gain insights in their economic burden.
