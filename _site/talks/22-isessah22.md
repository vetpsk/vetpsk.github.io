This is There is little known about the reasons for Dutch dairy culling decisions. The aim of the study was to identify the important reasons for culling producing cows, understand the culling strategies applied by Dutch farmers and their intentions of altering these strategies. An online survey was distributed on a national network of dairy farmers. This survey consisted of four parts, namely, farm characteristics (herd size, milking system, etc.), reasons for culling cows (primiparous and multiparous), strategies of culling and the intentions of farmers to alter their current strategy in the future. After collecting the responses over one month in 2021, descriptive analyses were performed. Of 176 respondents, 122 completed majority of the survey. Respondents had an average herd size of 128 cows. The average number of culled cows was 21 with an average herd age of 5.4 years. Of the reported reasons for recently culled primiparous cows, 34.4% and 18.9% were due to reproductive failure and low milk, respectively. In multiparous cow culling, 46.7%, 29.2% and 28.8% reported reproductive failure, presence of mastitis and, lameness as reasons respectively. For all cows, the least frequent reasons were available replacements, unwanted behaviour, and udder conformation. Regarding the culling strategies, 72% respondents reported that they adopted a clear culling plan. 80% of the respondents said that their culling decisions were unavoidable. 62.6% and 53% of respondents reported that they did not intend to alter their culling strategy for primiparous and multiparous cows respectively. Of others, 65% intended to decrease overall culling. 73% intended to alter their culling strategy for economic gain. In conclusion, most important reasons for culling of Dutch dairy cows were reproductive failure and presence of production diseases (mastitis and lameness). Most of the respondents followed specific culling strategies without intentions of altering it in the future. a description of your talk, which is a markdown files that can be all markdown-ified like any other post.
