Changes in agricultural policy such as milk-quota abolishment impact herd size and might influence the culling decisions of dairy farmers. The purpose of this study was to develop a modelling strategy for studying the relevant cow-level risk factors for survival of Dutch dairy cows representing production, reproduction and metabolic health performances under perturbations due to agricultural policy changes. An interval-censored Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model was developed using the data from a large national level database including observations on time-varying relevant risk factors under three different dairy policy periods between 2009 and 2019. Results show that the productive lifetime survival of dairy cows reduced over time and changed under the influence of different policies. However, the relevance of associated cow-level risk factors remained the same.
