New World Arenaviruses (NWA) cause viral hemorrhagic fever in humans, with high potential burden in terms of mortality and morbidity in susceptible populations. Primarily a spillover risk from rodent reservoirs to humans, the risk of infection is significantly affected by distribution of the rodent hosts and the movement patterns of humans. The aim of this study was to model the climate-change driven risk of zoonotic spillover of NWA by species distribution modelling (SDM) of the rodent reservoir species (Calomys musculinus, Zygodotomys brevicauda and Sigmodon alstoni. SDMs were developed using ensembles of four tree-based machine learning techniques trained on current bioclimatic and landscape data of the area under study. Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) of moderate and extremely negative type (SSP2 and SSP5 resp.) projections of climate change for year 2050 and 2070 were used as future scenarios for climate-change. Based on the two scenarios, predicted changes in the risk patterns and hotspots for zoonotic outbreaks were investigated. SDMs of rodent reservoirs of Junin virus in Argentina and Guanarito virus in Venezuela and Colombia yielded high precision in predicting species habitats ranging from 83% to 91%. Our study provides valuable insights into potential shifts in rodent habitat suitability and patterns.
