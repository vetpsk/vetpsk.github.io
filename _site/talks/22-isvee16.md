In the past decade there have been several changes in agricultural policy, affecting the culling in the Dutch dairy sector (e.g., abolishment of milk quota, phosphate regulations). The aim of this study was to analyse the survival of dairy cows on commercial Dutch dairy farms in response to these national policy changes. An Accelerated Failure Time model with survival intervals of weeks between test-days of the Milk Production Registration was applied. The data included 5,289,957 milk producing cows from 14,618 commercial dairy herds collected between 2009 and 2019. The associated cow-level risk factors for culling such as relative milk production, parities, number of inseminations (INS), fat-protein-ratio in early lactation, somatic cell count (SCC), were fitted in the model. Along with these, a factor representing three target policy periods, namely Milk Quota period (MQ), Post-Milk Quota period (PMQ) and Phosphate regulation period (PH) was fitted. The total culling events (x 1000) varied between 232-245 in MQ, 230-300 in PMQ and 287-338 in PH as seen in the figure. The median survival of the cows decreased by 2.7 and 15.3 weeks in PMQ and PH, respectively, compared to MQ. Risk factors such as relative milk production, parity, INS, and high fat-protein-ratio were positively associated whereas SCC and low fat-protein-ratio were negatively associated with survival time in all three policy periods. In conclusion, the survival age of cows was influenced by the agricultural policy changes and the association of cow-level risk factors for culling was consistent across the three policy periods.
